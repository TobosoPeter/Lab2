<h1>Shotgun;</h1>
<p>
  &quot;Because i don’t want another rematch / because how much more do we have to endure until we are allowed to end it / because i’m not brave enough for shotguns / because rope around neck means head above water and god i am terrified of drowning
dear knife / dear blade / i’m sorry for the triggers i’ve turned you into / i’m sorry i can’t look at you without thinking how sharp / without wondering how much pressure it’ll take to leave a mark / i’m sorry i do this to people, too&nbsp;&nbsp;.&quot;
